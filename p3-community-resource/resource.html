  <h1> Resource Community</h1>
  <p>Is Internet shaping the way we speak?  Unsurprisingly, we’ve invented new, more efficient and more appropriate ways of expressing ourselves online. Just look at the way that your grandparents speak in comparison to today’s teens, and you’ll get an idea of just how much language has changed in a short amount of time.We have collected some Internet prhases and expressions from Urban Dictionary as the community resource, attached with an additional interview with a UI designer, Yinan Song, to elborate more on the subject matter.</p>
